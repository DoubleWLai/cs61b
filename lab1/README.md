# [Lab 1: javac, java, git](https://sp18.datastructur.es/materials/lab/lab1/lab1)

## Introduction
A. Java Compilation & Development
Complete exercises 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 from the H61B textbook. Also consider reading Chapter 1.1 as a review of what you’ve already seen in lecture (either on video or in person). Note that the videos embedded in the textbook are just the lecture videos, so there’s no need to watch them again.
For this lab, you should use the command line, not an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse (see lab 2). Don’t worry about submitting your work yet, we’ll cover how to do that later in this lab.

B. Git & Local Repos
In 61B, you’ll be required to use the git version control tool, which is wildly popular out in the real world. Unfortunately, the abstractions behind it are fairly tricky to understand, so it is likely that you will encounter significant frustration at some point as you learn to use git.

C. Git Exercise
Now that you’ve read the first 3 sections of the Using Git Guide, you’re now ready to start using git! As part of your lab checkoff, you will be working through a small git workflow by setting up a git repository and making a couple commits to the repository.

D. Leap Year
In the lab1 folder, you should see a file called LeapYear.java. This program is supposed to test whether or not a given year is a Leap Year. The user will give a year as a command line parameter (examples given below), and then print out whether or not that year is a leap year.




## Deliverables

- LeapYear.java
- HelloWorld.java
- HelloNumbers.java
