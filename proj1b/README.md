# [Project 1B: Applying and Testing Data Structures version 1.0](https://sp18.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj1b/proj1b)

## Introduction

In most of your prior programming assignments, you’ve relied on some external source of truth to tell you that your code was correct.

In this project, you’ll use your deque from project 1A to solve a real world problem. Along the way, you’ll also write tests of your application to convince yourself that everything works correctly.

Unlike Project 1A, this project will be more highly scaffolded to reduce the workload in anticipation of the midterm.

Warning: The autograder output for this project is going to be terse and unhelpful. This is because we want you to use your tests to build confidence in your code. You will not be able to rely on the autograder for correctness.

## Deliverables

- Deque.java (created by you)
- Palindrome.java (created by you)
- OffByOne.java (created by you)
- OffByN.java (created by you)
- TestPalindrome.java
- TestOffByOne.java
